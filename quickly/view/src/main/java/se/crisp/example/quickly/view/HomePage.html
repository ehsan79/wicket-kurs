            <h1>Welcome to the home page!</h1>

            <p>You are running Wicket version: <span wicket:id="version"></span></p>
        </div>

        <h1>Here you start your journey</h1>

        <p>
            This is a starting plate for your Wicket with Spring repository project.
            Also included is Twitter Bootstrap, the CSS framework and Lombok which gives
            us auto-generated getters, setters, equals, hashcode and toString.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two maven modules, Core and View, which have a common parent: Quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Core</b> is the backend which is configured by the CoreConfiguration class.
            There you will find that if there is no database in the JNDI, a fall back to an
            <strong>in-memory database</strong> will happen.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <b>View</b> module is for your practicing of Wicket.
            Here is a BasePage and a HomePage, the latter inherits from the former.
            You are currently reading HomePage. The HomePage logic is found in the class with the same name.
        </p>

        <h2>Start this as a web application</h2>

        <p>
            To start this you could either build and install to your own Tomcat with a proper MySQL database or
            run everything in a Jetty container with an in-memory database.
        </p>
        <h3>Running in IntelliJ</h3>
        <p>
            With IntelliJ, browse the Maven
            structure, go to the view module, go to Plugins, go to jetty and right-click on jetty:run.
            Select "Debug view [[jetty:run]]". The web application should start at localhost:8080.
            Selecting debug instead of run gives you hot deploy on build (Ctrl-F9) and fewer restarts
            of the container.
        </p>

        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>

        <p>
            Add a link from this page to another, new page. You must edit this HTML file and add an
            anchor somewhere. Below is a hint for your Java code. Another hint, this page shows the
            current version of Wicket, how is that done?
        </p>
        <pre>
            add(new Link("nextPage") {
                @Override
                public void onClick() {
                    setResponsePage(new MyNewPage());
                }
            });
        </pre>
        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>

        <p>
            Write a test that verifies the clicking on the link takes us to the correct page. There is some code
            in the HomePageTest that is guarded by comments. Make it work!
